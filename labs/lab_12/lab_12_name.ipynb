    "In this lab, you will compute the expected plate flexural response for loading as represented by a bathymetric profile. You will decompose the bathymetric profile into a Fourier series and compute the response for each periodic component of the load, then sum these responses to obtain the full profile. This lab will 1) familiarize you with Python's basic FFT functionality (using the [`numpy.fft`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/routines.fft.html) module) and 2) give you practice computing flexural responses for periodic loads.\n",

    "Fourier series break a periodic function down into a sum of cosines and sines of varying amplitudes and frequencies. The \"Fourier coefficients\" control the weighting given to each individual cosine or sine. For a continuous function $s(x)$ periodic on the interval $[-\\lambda/2, \\lambda/2]$ (i.e., with wavelength $\\lambda$), the Fourier coefficients are given by\n",
