    "## 1. Explicit finite difference solution to the heat equation\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab we are going to model the temperature of an infinite slab over time using a basic finite difference scheme. To do this, we're taking a very important intellectual step: we move from continuous, analytical solutions, to discrete models of time and space in a numerical solution scheme. As we showed in class, the heat flows in one dimension if we can say that the slab is infinite in the other two directions. There is no movement of material (no advection) and the properties of the material are homogeneous and constant in time. The top of the slab at $x(0)$ is held at a constant temperature of 400 °C, the bottom side $x(L)$ is held at a constant temperature of 100 °C, and the rest of it is *initially* at 70 °C. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our equation then looks like:\n",
    "        \n",
    "$$\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t}T = \\kappa \\frac{\\mathrm{d^2}}{\\mathrm{d}x^2}T, \\tag{1}$$\n",
    "        \n",
    "where $\\kappa$ is the coefficient of thermal diffusivity. \n",
    "        \n",
    "In order to model the change in temperature distribution in space over time, we will employ a numerical scheme to calculate the temperature at a location at time $t_j$. To achieve this, and because we are interested in just one direction, we will break our slab into $N$ layers. The temperature in any layer $i$ at time $t_j$ will then be $T_i^j$. The figure below provides a sketch of the problem setup:\n",

    "Our equation has a first derivative in time and a second derivative in space that we need to be able to calculate. In our discrete space, a first derivative can be accomplished by taking either the forward derivative: \n",
    "        \n",
    "$$\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}x}T = \\frac{T_{i+1}^j - T_{i}^j}{\\Delta x}\\,, \\tag{2}$$\n",
    "        \n",

    "        \n",
    "Try to visualize these in the figure above! As you walk through the layer to calculate the derivative, convince yourself that you know which elements are used in the caluclation of the derivative at which location. There are various ways to dealing with ODEs, PDEs numerically, a Numerical Analysis class/book can provide the proper treatment of that subject.\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate the second derivative in Equation (1), we apply the forward and backward derivatives together, which generates a *centered* derivative: \n",
    "    \n",
    "$$\\frac{\\mathrm{d^2}}{\\mathrm{d}x^2}T = \\frac{T_{i+1}^j - 2T_{i}^j + T_{i-1}^j}{(\\Delta x)^2}\\,. \\tag{4}$$\n",
    "        \n",
    "Replacing the derivatives in Equation (1) with their numerical equivalents, we can rewrite our heat equation as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{T_i^{j+1} - T_i^{j}}{\\Delta t} = \\kappa\\frac{T_{i+1}^j - 2T_{i}^j + T_{i-1}^j}{(\\Delta x)^2}\\,. \\tag{5}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, this can be rearranged to get a solution for the temperature in layer $i$ at the next time step, $j+1$: \n",
    "        \n",
    "$$T_i^{j+1} = T_i^{j} +\\frac{\\kappa \\Delta t}{(\\Delta x)^2}\\left[ T_{i+1}^j - 2T_{i}^j + T_{i-1}^j\\right]. \\tag{6}$$       \n",

    "For convenience, let's set\n",

    "$$\\mu = \\frac{\\kappa \\Delta t}{(\\Delta x)^2}. \\tag{7}$$\n",
    "        \n",
    "Why can we do this? We require that $\\Delta t$ is a constant time step throughout the entire calculation and $\\Delta x$ is a constant distance between layers. Since these will not change, we can incorporate them into a constant coefficient. Note that you don't have to make these assumptions. We are left with the equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$T_i^{j+1} = T_i^{j} +\\mu \\left[ T_{i+1}^j - 2T_{i}^j + T_{i-1}^j\\right]. \\tag{8}$$\n",
    "        \n",
    "The temperature at the next time step, $j+1$, is defined by the temperature at the current time step, $j$, in the current location, $i$, and its neighbors $i\\pm1$. To find a solution, we require knowledge of an *initial condition*, here the intial temperature distribution in the slab. Fortunately, this was given in the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do you notice any problems with this scheme laid out in Equation 8? What happens at the top and bottom layers for $i=0$ and $i=N-1$, respectively? Layers $T_0$ and $T_{N-1}$ have only one neighbor, so calculating the central difference is not possible, one of the terms of the central difference simply does not exist. However, the *boundary conditions* specify what temperature we should apply! In our case, the top and bottom layer of the slab do not change temperature because of the way the boundary conditions are specified. So we only need to calculate the interior points, and our scheme will work just fine.\n",
