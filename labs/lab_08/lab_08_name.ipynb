    "> 1. Use the provided `legendre_schmidt()` function, and make sure you renormalize (see the provided code in `spharm()`).\n",
    "> 2. The `legendre_schmidt()` function will compute all of the associated Legendre functions for $m=0$ to $n$ with a single call. Therefore, you only need to call this function once for each $n$. Look at the help (type `legendre_schmidt?`) and see how the function stores the return values. Start with some very low degree terms ($n=2$ or $n=3$) and familiarize yourself with the structure of the output arrays.\n",
    "> 3. For a given $n$ and $m$, if the $P_{nm}$ for various values of $\\theta$ are stored in a column vector, and the sin and cos terms for various values of longitude are stored in a row vector, the column vector times the row vector will produce a matrix with all of the appropriate theta and phi combinations. See the code in `spharm()`. You can also do this via `for` loops, but it is much, much slower."
