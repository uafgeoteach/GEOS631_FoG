    "\n",
    "In this lab we will use a Python library to retrieve and plot Earth's magnetic field. Along the way, you'll learn a little more about making maps with Python. Recall that Earth's magnetic field can be approximated as a dipole (that is, a bar magnet) with its axis subparallel to Earth's rotational axis. The reality is that the magnetic field is more complicated and is in fact temporally varying. The image below, from a computer simulation of Earth's magnetic field, demonstrates this complexity:\n",

    "Earth's magnetic field is a **vector field** that is generally defined with three numbers:\n",
    "\n",
    "* inclination\n",
    "* declination\n",
    "* intensity\n",
    "\n",
    "Inclination and declination together define the *direction* of the magnetic field, and the intensity defines the *magnitude*. We'll only work with inclination and declination in this lab. The below image shows how they're defined using a standard magnetic compass:\n",

    "\n",
    "Magnetic declination is particularly important because it has implications for navigation — compasses point to the magnetic north pole, not the geographic north pole! This is why serious navigational maps/charts include the declination on the compass rose.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab we will explore both the temporal and spatial complexity of Earth's magnetic field using a reference magnetic field called the International Geomagnetic Reference Field (IGRF). Earth's magnetic field a fascinating topic, and it has a well-written Wikipedia entry [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_magnetic_field).\n",

This package provides a function called `igrf()` which allows you to obtain the magnetic field vector for a given geodetic latitude, longitude, altitude, and time (remember, the magnetic field is time-varying!). Here's an example which retrieves the magnetic field vector at Earth's surface at the location of Fairbanks at the beginning of 2010:"
