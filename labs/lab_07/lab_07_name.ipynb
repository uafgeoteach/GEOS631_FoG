    "    \n",
    "In this lab you will combine gravity anomaly and isostasy calculations to explore the gravity signature of a passive continental margin (i.e., where the edge of a continent does not coincide with a plate boundary). The east coast of the US is a good example of a passive continental margin. These geologic settings have relatively simpler gravity anomalies due to the lack of a subducting slab and associated volcanism.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, some mathematical background. The equation for the gravity anomaly produced by a semi-infinite slab is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\Delta g(x) = 2G \\Delta \\rho \\Delta h [(\\pi/2) + \\arctan(x/z)]\\,, \\tag{1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that $G = 6.673 \\times 10^{-11} m^3 kg^{-1} s^{-2}$, a rather unwieldy expression in these units. A more compact form with $\\Delta g(x)$ **in units of mGal** is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\Delta g(x) = 13.34 \\Delta \\rho \\Delta h [(\\pi/2) + \\arctan(x/z)]\\,, \\tag{1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "which requires the density contrast $\\Delta \\rho$ in g/cm$^3$, the thickness of the slab $\\Delta h$ in km, the depth to the **center** of the slab $z$ in km, and horizontal distance from the edge of the slab $x$ in km. The geometry is shown below:\n",

    "direction. A computed value every 2 km should provide sufficient sampling to understand the problem. Include your answer in a **new code cell** below.\n",
