    "In this lab you will combine gravity anomaly and isostasy calculations to explore the gravity signature of a passive continental margin (i.e., where the edge of a continent does not coincide with a plate boundary). The east coast of the US is a good example of a passive continental margin. These geologic settings have relatively simpler gravity anomalies due to the lack of a subducting slab and associated volcanism.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, some mathematical background. The equation for the gravity anomaly (in units of mGal) produced by a semi-infinite slab is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\Delta g(x) = 13.34 \\Delta \\rho \\Delta h [(\\pi/2) + \\arctan(x/z)]\\,, \\tag{1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\Delta \\rho$ is the density contrast in g/cm$^3$, $\\Delta h$ is the thickness of the slab in km, $z$ is the depth to the **center** of the slab (km), and $x$ is horizontal distance from the edge of the slab (km). The geometry is shown below:\n",
