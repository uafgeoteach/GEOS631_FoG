    "\n",
    "The computing assignment today is intended to give you some practice with Python. In particular, the Python skills you will work with are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Manipulating data in arrays\n",
    "2. Plotting\n",
    "3. Calculating numerical integrations\n",
    "4. Introduction to some common Python packages: [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) (providing $n$-dimensional arrays and numerical computing tools), [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/) (numerical tools, signal processing, statistics, optimization, ...), and [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) (plotting, with commands very similar to MATLAB). \n",
    "\n",
    "## Calculating River Discharge from Field Data\n",
    "\n",
    "River discharge is defined as the volume of water passing through a cross section at a certain time. It has units of $\\text{m}^3~\\text{s}^{-1}$ and ranges from $1~\\text{m}^3~\\text{s}^{-1}$ for a small alpine stream to over $200000~\\text{m}^3~\\text{s}^{-1}$ for the Amazon. Calculating the discharge of a river is relatively simple in theory, but you do have to be careful in collecting and dealing with real data!\n",

    "<div style=\"text-align:right\"><em>Image courtesy Erin Pettit, OSU</em></div>\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to measure river discharge, we could measure volume somehow (buckets?) and count the number of buckets we fill in a certain amount of time. This would work for measuring the discharge out of your kitchen faucet, but it doesn't really work for a real river. The alternative is to look at the units of Volume / Time and realize that it is the same as Area $\\times$ Velocity:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\text{m}^3}{\\text{s}} = \\text{m}^2 \\times \\frac{\\text{m}}{\\text{s}}\\,,$$\n",

    "This means we can measure the cross sectional area of a point on the river (where the bridge crosses, for example) and then measure the velocity of the water going through that cross sectional area.\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we do this?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Given depth measurements, we estimate the cross sectional area.\n",
    "2. Given point velocity measurements we estimate the velocity of the whole cross section\n",
    "\n",
    "It is not as easy as it sounds to do this in real life, so we have to make some assumptions.\n",

    "## Plotting the Data\n",

    "For the first calculations we have given you a nicely gridded data set.\n",
