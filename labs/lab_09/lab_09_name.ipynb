    "A function to read the EGM96 model is provided as `read_EGM96()`. Before you can compute anomalies, you will need to subtract out the WGS84 reference gravity field. A fragment of code that does this is given below — WGS84 includes terms for J2, J4, J6, J8, and J10. EGM96 is complete to degree and order 360. When you evaluate the gravity field, use the maximum degree and order that your Colab runtime will handle within a reasonable time. Use a smaller maximum degree (around 50 or so) for code development and then increase it for the final result."
