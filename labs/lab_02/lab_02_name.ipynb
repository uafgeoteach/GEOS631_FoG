    "## Numerically Calculating Average Velocities\n",
    "\n",
    "For calculating average velocities it is easiest to think of each of each of our measurement data as being one column of water 1 meter wide with a height equal to the water depth and a surface velocity equal to the measured velocity. We want to calculate the average velocity for each column separately, because the column of water has different heights for different positions $x$ across the river, short columns near the edges and tall columns near the middle. We have two ways of calculating this. We can use the analytical expression you derived last week, or we can numerically integrate the velocity profile (which we might need to do if the profile $v(z)$ doesn't have a nice equation like the one provided in last week's lab).\n",

    "Of course if we can calculate the average of a profile analytically, that is easiest. Using your derived expression for $k$ and for the average velocity $\\bar{v}$, we can calculate the average velocity for each column of water. But we want to take advantage of NumPy's ability to work with arrays, so rather than doing a separate calculation for each column, or doing a `for` loop, we will do it using simpler manipulations of matrices. NumPy can add, multiply, and divide matrices (in NumPy parlance, both matrices and vectors are called \"arrays\") that are the same size element-by-element very quickly. Here are some examples:"
